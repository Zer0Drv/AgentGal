Multi-Agent Roleplay / Narrative Game Project. The current implementation is built around **FastAPI + pydantic-ai + Pydantic structured output + file-based memory + sqlite-vec**, using `uv` as the project manager.

## Core Design

- **Independent Memory**: Characters maintain their own `memory.jsonl / status.md`; the `narrator` maintains `status.md` and raw history
- **Information Asymmetry**: Messages are scoped via `visible_to`; characters not present in a scene cannot see that round's content
- **Narrator-First**: The `narrator` handles routing and scene progression before sequentially invoking target characters
- **Structured Output**: All structured agents use `PromptedOutput`, not XML; the system reads typed fields directly and writes them back to files
- **Dual-Layer Memory**: Markdown files are human-readable and editable; the vector store handles retrieval

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI + SSE (Server-Sent Events)
- pydantic-ai (`pydantic-ai`) — `Agent` / `PromptedOutput` / `OpenAIChatModel`
- sqlite-vec + aiosqlite
- asyncio

### Layered Dependency Direction

```
models/        ← (self only)            # innermost domain layer: entities + value objects + 纯领域规则
repository/    ← models/                 # infra: files / vector / LLM clients / logging; must NOT import app/ or server
app/           ← models/ + repository/   # use cases: orchestration + agent assembly + LLM* DTOs + response post-processing
server.py      ← all
```

无独立 `shared/`——原 shared 已按归属拆散：游戏日期值对象与 soul 派生规则进 `models/`，config / status 格式解析 / 消息助手进 `repository/`，LLM 输出后处理进 `app/`（判据：领域无关才配做通用工具，否则它有自己的层）。

依赖方向由 `tests/test_layer_dependencies.py` 用 AST 静态强制（新增反向 import 会让对应用例失败）：models 不依赖任何外层；repository 不反依赖 app/server；app 不依赖 server。LLM 调用收敛在 `repository/`（sdk_runner + llm/ 客户端），agent 装配与 LLM* DTO 在 `app/`，consolidation/memory 检索流水线是 `app/` 子包。

## Runtime File Responsibilities

### Character Files

- `soul.md`: Handwritten character definition, read-only; divided into six sections: `<identity>` / `<goal>` / `<past>` / `<habits>` / `<reactions>` / `<voice>`. The `<goal>` section describes the character's deepest inner desires (desires around ability/achievement + deep relational longing)
- `memory.jsonl`: Character long-term memory, one structured `EpisodeMemory` per line (`id / date / time / location / participants / keywords / importance / content / memory_owner / title / raw_dialogue / last_recalled_at`), append-only, characters only; `id` is a stable UUID, `last_recalled_at` defaults to the event date and is refreshed from SQLite into saved archives, and old data can be backfilled with `scripts/backfill_episode_ids.py`
- `memory_draft.jsonl`: On-disk buffer for each round's `output.memory` (characters only), each line is `{"turn": int, "text": str}`; after consolidation's `EpisodeClosureDetector` determines closure, slices are read by `until_turn` to produce structured `EpisodeMemory` appended to `memory.jsonl`. Merged entries are removed from draft; unclosed turn entries are retained
- `understanding.jsonl`: Stable understandings formed by the character, one structured `Understanding` per line (`id / memory_owner / subject / keywords / content / linked_episodes / history`); unlike `EpisodeMemory`, this records durable beliefs or interaction patterns rather than single events. `history` belongs to that single Understanding and records the initial version plus content-changing updates as `{episode_id / date / title / content}`; link-only evidence updates do not append history entries
- `status.md`: Current status (prose fields only). Characters contain "心境 / 在意的事 / Relationship with Player"; narrator contains "场景 / 当前时间 / Character Locations / 叙事焦点 …". 打算 / 待触发事件 are no longer status.md sections — they live in `intents.json` / `pending_events.json` (see `intent_queue`). Narrator's "Relationship with Player" is not stored either — it is computed at prompt-build time from each character's own status (`- Character Display Name: Relationship`)

### History Files

- Current dialogue history is **only written** to `data/runtime/characters/narrator/raw/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`
- Each message carries `visible_to`
- When characters read context, they filter messages by visibility

### Other Runtime Files

- `data/runtime/characters/last_choices.json`: Latest set of player options, restored on load, cleared on reset
- `data/runtime/characters/.turn_counter.json`: Global narrator-turn counter, incremented by 1 for each narrator message; a turn starts with one narrator message and continues through character responses plus the next player input, until the following narrator message starts a new turn. Raw JSONL and `memory_draft.jsonl` entries carry turn numbers for `EpisodeClosureDetector` closure detection; reset clears with characters directory, and the opening narrator message writes the first turn
- `data/runtime/characters/narrator/world_schedule.json`: Narrator-owned world event calendar; `state_updater` reads `events[].status` to push pending public school/world events by date and story phase, and runtime marks triggered world events as `status="triggered"`; can be replaced wholesale by `world_schedule_update` when the story moves to a new environment
- `data/runtime/characters/narrator/tasks.md`: Optional story seed file; current main flow primarily syncs "Pending Events" from character "Intentions" via `state_updater`
- `data/runtime/characters/*/.history_window_state.json`: Per-agent dialogue history high/low water mark window sidecar
- `data/runtime/characters/*/.consolidation_state.json`: Character memory consolidation progress sidecar
- `data/runtime/characters/*/.memory_recall_state.json`: Legacy character long-term memory recall snapshot; new saves do not generate it, but old saves may still load it as a fallback when `memory.jsonl` lacks `last_recalled_at`

## Message Routing

The `narrator` decides who participates in the current round.

```text
User Input → narrator → targets: ["existing character name", ...] (LLMNarratorOutput.targets; may be empty if only introducing new characters this round)
```

### Narrator Responsibilities

- Analyze player input, output `targets` of currently existing characters who can respond this round; may be empty if only introducing new characters, the orchestration layer will add them after incubation
- Determine whether the player still wishes to interact with characters: if so, continue the current scene; if parting, skipping time, or no longer interacting, steer toward pending events or create equivalent immediate tension
- Every round must ensure at least one major character can perceive and respond to the player
- Describe time, location, present characters, environment, pure NPC behavior, and current hooks
- Do not add future events; future events are maintained by `state_updater` from character "Intentions"
- When the plot requires introducing a new character with relationship anchors, list `LLMNewCharacterRequest` anchors via `LLMNarratorOutput.new_characters` (`name_hint` is just an optional name hint); `app/character_factory.py` generates `character_id` and incubates the directory; the orchestration layer automatically adds successfully incubated new characters to this round's response list. Pure passersby are not generated, described directly in `present_characters` / `scene_description`
- **Never speak for characters or decide their actions**

## Single-Round Dialogue Flow

```text
User Message
  ↓
Invoke narrator, get LLMNarratorOutput (targets + date + time + location + present_characters + scene_description + new_characters)
  ↓
Incubate new_characters: `character_factory` generates `character_id`, writes soul/status/memory; successfully incubated new characters enter this round's final response list
  ↓
Write structured narrator output to single raw history (with visible_to)
  ↓
Sequentially invoke each target Agent (each agent response is written to history before the next can see it)
  ↓
After each Agent response: write back from LLMCharacterOutput typed fields, broadcast to history
  ↓
Launch three post-response lines together:
  1. choice generation → cancellable auxiliary task; if it finishes before the next player input, display 2-3 optional actions and persist them to `last_choices.json`
  2. state_updater → update narrator/status.md (narrative focus, pending events; "Relationship with Player" is not stored — it is computed at prompt-build time from each character's status)
  3. detect_and_consolidate(current_turn) → determine episode closure and merge memories (see "Memory Consolidation")
  ↓
Emit `response_done` so the UI can re-enable free input while those lines continue
  ↓
state_updater inputs in order: `characters_status` (深层目标/身份/心境/在意的事/打算 per character; 深层目标 read from each character's soul.md `<goal>`), `world_schedule`, latest_scene_json, current_narrator_status, recent_history
  ↓
narrator_service.route() writes 场景 / 当前时间 / 角色位置 synchronously to narrator/status.md before post-response tasks start; state_updater does not write these fields.
  ↓
state_updater reads the input blocks and decides on its own whether the upcoming plot needs new pending events (add_event) and what they are — no fixed sourcing taxonomy or per-round quota; the prompt states only the raw materials and the output contract. It still maintains a few mechanical fields: recent_world_event (a derived narrator status field prefixed with `（phase）`; "" keeps the old value), triggered_world_events (the pushed world-schedule event names, runtime marks them triggered), and world_schedule_update (full new calendar only on a major world change such as graduation / new environment).
  ↓
triggered prunes the narrator "待触发事件" queue (events that fired, were missed, or are duplicate); add_event names must keep the 【角色显示名：事件名】 prefix because triggered / mark_triggered match by that string
```

Observation mode uses the same SSE chat endpoint with `mode="observe"`: the narrator runs with the observation prompt, the player message is not written to raw history, selected characters respond to the narrator scene, choices are cleared instead of generated, and state update / consolidation still run after the round.

## Agent Output and Writeback Mechanism

All structured agents use pydantic-ai's `PromptedOutput` structured output, no longer using XML `<update_notes>`:

- `LLMCharacterOutput`: `content`, `memory`, `status`, `triggered`, `add_event`
- `LLMNarratorOutput`: `targets`, `date`, `time`, `location`, `present_characters`, `scene_description`, `new_characters` (routing, structured scene state, and dynamic character requests)
- `LLMNewCharacterRequest` / `LLMNewCharacterProfile`: New character incubation anchor (optional `name_hint`, no `character_id`) and character_factory's complete output (includes `character_id`, final `display_name`, `initial_status`)
- `LLMEpisodeMemory`: Single long-term memory event output by `EpisodeMemoryGenerator` (`date / time / location / participants / keywords / importance / content / title`), completed with a stable `id` by the write path and injected with `memory_owner` and `raw_dialogue` (original dialogue trace, metadata only, not vector-indexed, not in recall text), then appended to character `memory.jsonl`
- `EpisodeClosureDetector` output type: `dict[str, list[LLMEpisodeClosureBoundary]]` (key is the character's `agent_name` appearing in recent_history; value is all theme boundaries detected for that character in history, sorted by `end_turn` ascending, empty array means no boundaries. Each boundary contains `end_turn / old_theme / new_theme / reason`. Consumer only adopts local candidate characters, and takes the maximum `end_turn` from each array as this round's mergeable closure point)
- `LLMUnderstandingPatch`: add/update patch for stable `Understanding` records; entries contain `subject / keywords / content` (LLM does not output `linked_episodes`; the flow layer injects the current episode id automatically), while ids and owners are maintained by the flow layer
- `LLMStateUpdate`: `status`, `triggered`, `add_event` (post-round background narrator state maintenance)
- `LLMChoices`: `choices`

The runtime is split four ways (domain → repository → app → server): `models/Character` is a thin frozen-dataclass entity (`name` + read-only `soul`, derived `display_name`); `repository/character_repo.py` (`CharacterRepository`) and `repository/narrator_repo.py` (`NarratorRepository`) own all file I/O — soul caching, status read, and the writeback policy (`apply_status_fields` / `append_memory`; narrator's `write_scene` / world_schedule read-write); `app/conversation_service.py` (`ConversationService.run_turn`) and `app/narrator_service.py` (`NarratorService.route` / `update_state`) hold the orchestration. LLM DTOs are unpacked into primitives inside the Services before calling the repos, so `repository/` never imports `app/`. There is no global entity registry; Services obtain entities via `CharacterRepository.load(name)`, and `reset_entities()` (in `server.py`) invalidates the character soul cache on load / reset (narrator soul is read fresh, not cached). 打算 / 待触发事件 are typed lists in `repository/intent_queue.py` (`add` / `remove` / `render`), not status.md sections — the Services call `intent_queue.add(name, section, ...)` / `intent_queue.remove(...)` with the section constant (打算 / 待触发事件); the `无`-sentinel skip and【名】dedup live there. Because the queue is a real list, there is no "bulk-overwrite an event section" path to guard against. Narrator's `和玩家的关系` is no longer materialized — `prompt_builder.render_player_relations()` computes it at prompt-build time from each character's own status (single source of truth).

### Writeback Rules

- `output.memory` → append one record tagged with current narrator turn number to `memory_draft.jsonl` (after `EpisodeClosureDetector` determines closure turn, consolidation slices by `until_turn` to produce `EpisodeMemory` appended to `memory.jsonl`, merged entries removed from draft)
- `output.status` → overwrite corresponding prose fields in `status.md` (心境 / 在意的事 / 场景 …)
- `output.triggered` → `intent_queue.remove`: drop the matching `【名】` entry from the queue
- `output.add_event` → `intent_queue.add`: prepend a new entry (skips `无` sentinel and `【名】` duplicates)

Where:

- `narrator` operates the `待触发事件` queue (`pending_events.json`)
- Other characters operate the `打算` queue (`intents.json`)
- These queues are typed `list[str]` files, not status.md sections; they are rendered back into the prompt's `<status>` block by `build_status_block` so the LLM input format is unchanged. There is no bulk-overwrite path, so no guard is needed.

## Prompt Composition

### Design Principles

- Keep system prompts stable, put dynamic content in user messages to improve prompt cache hit rate
- Do not arbitrarily adjust context block order; current order is specifically tuned for cache and retrieval hit rates

### Character Agent

`system` message contains:

1. `soul.md`
2. `prompts.runtime_prompts.CHARACTER`
3. Allowlisted fields for writeback

`user` message is assembled into a **single large message** in the following order:

1. Recent visible dialogue history (built from raw JSONL; filtered by `visible_to`; high/low water mark truncation; history contains all narrator messages)
2. `status.md`
3. `<relevant_memories>` (long-term memory recall from `memory.jsonl`, vector store side still renders as markdown for LLM reading)
4. `<relevant_understandings>` (stable understanding recall from `understanding.jsonl`; relevance-only ranking, no recency or recall-state update)
5. Current round player input

### Narrator Agent

`system` message contains:

1. `soul.md`
2. `prompts.runtime_prompts.NARRATOR`

`user` message is assembled into a **single large message** in the following order:

1. Recent dialogue history (narrator keeps all recent messages in the active history window, including narrator messages)
2. `<fields>` (list of all active characters)
3. `status.md`
4. Current round player input

`narrator` does not use vector recall; it relies on scene, narrative focus, pending events (the `待触发事件` queue, rendered into `<status>`), and "Relationship with Player" to advance the current round. Pending events are primarily synced by `state_updater` from character "打算", event names preserve character names (e.g. `【Mitsuki: Promise to Walk Together】`). "Relationship with Player" is computed at render time from each character's status, format `- Mitsuki: Lover`.

> Note: `<world_now>` (derived projection of current time / real-time character locations) is currently disabled. During this period narrator only reads fields maintained by author/state_updater in `status.md`.

Narrator uses the main LLM configuration (`LLM_*` env vars).

### Choice Generation

After each participation round of character responses, `generate_choices()` is launched alongside `state_updater` and memory consolidation to generate 2-3 player-selectable actions. The player input box is already usable while choices are still generating. Starting a new `/api/chat` round invalidates and cancels any pending choice generation, clears stale saved choices, and prevents late results from writing `last_choices.json`. Observation rounds skip choice generation and clear `last_choices.json`.

- Prompt source: `prompts.runtime_prompts.CHOICES`
- Reuses the main `LLM_*` configuration
- Output style is player dialogue (may include parenthetical action descriptions), not action instructions
- Options are displayed as both text and buttons, persisted to `last_choices.json`

## Long-Term Memory Retrieval

- Vector store indexes long-term memory events from `memory.jsonl` and stable understandings from `understanding.jsonl` in separate tables; owner scope is fixed to current character
- Each turn retrieves both episode memories (`<relevant_memories>`) and stable understandings (`<relevant_understandings>`); `app/memory_query_builder.py` builds retrieval queries from the character's own `在意的事` status field (used only by the lexical/BM25 queries) and the current location (used only by the episode semantic query), extracted from the latest visible narrator message
- Retrieval query construction (`app/memory_query_builder.py` → `RetrievalQueries`): read character's `在意的事` from their own `status.md`; extract `location` from the most recent narrator message visible to that character; build four queries, each falls back to current player input if empty:
  - `episode` (semantic, limit 1800 chars): location + user_input (`在意的事` is kept out of the embedding query to avoid query drift; location anchors episode scene searches and the EpisodeMemory embedding index includes location)
  - `episode_bm25` (lexical, limit 700 chars): `在意的事` + user_input (location is not a useful BM25 signal)
  - `understanding` (semantic, limit 1200 chars): user_input only (understandings are not place-bound, and `在意的事` is kept out to avoid query drift)
  - `understanding_bm25` (lexical, limit 700 chars): `在意的事` + user_input
- `app/memory/retrieval.py` handles the full retrieval pipeline: semantic query embedding → vector candidates + optional BM25 lexical candidates → hybrid fusion → (optional) rerank → recency sort → recall state update
- `repository/vector_store.py` is storage layer only: provides raw candidates for EpisodeMemory and Understanding tables, pipeline logic is not here
- `app/memory/indexer.py` reads `EpisodeMemory` records from `memory.jsonl` and `Understanding` records from `understanding.jsonl`, then appends them to the vector store
- Recall ranking: vector relevance and BM25 relevance are fused first, rerank (optional) replaces relevance signal, then in-game time recency is layered on top
- When Logfire is configured, memory retrieval logs each round's semantic query, BM25 query, and top hit summary for debugging recall quality
- `last_recalled_at` is updated in SQLite on hit; save export merges the latest DB value into the archived `memory.jsonl`, while the working `memory.jsonl` remains append-only
- `app/memory/indexer.rebuild_memory_index()` reads `memory.jsonl.last_recalled_at` to restore the long-term memory index; when `clear_existing=True` (the default, used on load), it also rebuilds the Understanding index via the shared `_rebuild_understanding_index_for_agents` helper. Legacy `.memory_recall_state.json` is only a fallback for old saves whose `memory.jsonl` lacks `last_recalled_at`. `rebuild_understanding_index()` is still available as a standalone function for targeted rebuilds (e.g. after consolidation patches a single agent's understandings)

## Memory Consolidation

`app/consolidation/flow.py` handles character background consolidation:

- Triggered as a background task by `detect_and_consolidate(current_turn)` at the end of each round (concurrent with `state_updater`): first scans characters with `memory_draft.jsonl` as candidates, calls `EpisodeClosureDetector` to determine which characters have closed episodes this round (returns `{agent_name: closed_at_turn}`); closed characters execute `consolidate_agent(name, until_turn=closed_at_turn)` in parallel
- `consolidate_agent` slices draft entries + raw dialogue for the corresponding turn range from `memory_draft.jsonl` by `until_turn`, hands to `EpisodeMemoryGenerator` to produce a single structured `EpisodeMemory`; flow layer injects `memory_owner` and `raw_dialogue`, then appends to `memory.jsonl`. Merged entries are removed from draft; unclosed turn entries are retained. On failure, entire draft is retained for retry next round
- Patches `understanding.jsonl` from the new `EpisodeMemory`, preserving existing linked episode ids, initializing per-Understanding `history` on add and appending to it when `content` changes, and syncing changed Understanding records to the vector store
- Syncs vector index by progress

`narrator` does not maintain `memory.jsonl`, nor does it participate in consolidation.

## Configuration Sources

### `.env`

- Holds secrets, model IDs, and external service URLs
- `EMBEDDING_DIM=auto` or an empty value means the embedding client omits `dimensions` and the vector store creates sqlite-vec tables from the first real embedding length; numeric values are only for embedding services that support the `dimensions` parameter
- Rerank calls are only truly enabled when `RERANK_MODEL` is configured
- Generated dialogue, background generation, and choice generation all use the main `LLM_*` configuration

### `config.toml`

- Holds runtime strategy parameters, such as Agent temperature, LLM retry attempts, character/consolidation/choice generation timeouts, embedding/rerank request timeouts, vector retrieval weights
- `[history]`'s `history_high` / `history_low` control multi-round dialogue high/low water mark truncation (in distinct turn counts, anchored by turn number, stored in `.history_window_state.json`'s `start_turn` field); `raw_scan_turns` limits how many turns narrator routing / character running / choice generation reads from raw history (consolidation flow slices by turn, not subject to this limit)

## Save and Reset

Handled by `repository/save_manager.py`, exposed via FastAPI endpoints:

- `POST /api/save`: Export a new immutable worldline node zip to `saves/`; filename-based overwrite is rejected
- `GET /api/saves`: List saves and return temporary worldline trees grouped by `story_id`
- `DELETE /api/save/{filename}`: Delete the Game tree rooted at the given save
- `DELETE /api/save-node/{filename}`: Delete one save only when it has no child branches
- `POST /api/load`: Restore save and rebuild necessary indexes
- `POST /api/reset`: Reset runtime data from `data/templates/{story_id}`

Save includes:

- `metadata.json` (save metadata: `save_id`, `parent_save_id`, `story_id`, `created_at`, `turn`, `title`, `focus`; this is the only persisted branch relationship source)
- `.save_id` (current save node id restored on load; reset clears it so the first save is a root node)
- Character markdown / jsonl files (`narrator` does not include `memory.jsonl` / `memory_draft.jsonl`)
- Character `memory.jsonl` (structured long-term memory, one `EpisodeMemory` per line, includes stable `id`, `raw_dialogue` trace field, and archive-refreshed `last_recalled_at`)
- Character `memory_draft.jsonl` (when present; each line `{"turn": int, "text": str}`, ensuring unclosed merge memories are not lost on save)
- Character `understanding.jsonl` (when present; stable beliefs linked back to EpisodeMemory ids)
- Character `intents.json` / narrator `pending_events.json` (when present; the 打算 / 待触发事件 typed-list queues)
- Narrator raw history (each entry carries turn number)
- Narrator `world_schedule.json` when present
- Per-agent `.history_window_state.json`
- Character `.consolidation_state.json`
- `last_choices.json`
- `.turn_counter.json` (global turn counter)

Currently built-in story templates:

- `school`: `mitsuki` / `narrator`
- `modern`: `chenxiao` / `guyining` / `narrator`

## Development Conventions

### Code Design

- Keep DRY, but don't abstract for abstraction's sake
- Prioritize simple, explicit, good-enough-for-now implementations
- One function does one thing, keep complexity controlled
- Complete type annotations (Python 3.11+)

### Error Handling

- LLM / embedding / database calls must retain contextual logs
- Check paths and existence before file operations
- Prohibit bare `except:`, catch specific exceptions

### Concurrency and Async

- All I/O operations use `async/await`
- Multi-character invocations use `asyncio.gather()` for parallel execution
- Consider concurrency protection for shared resources (files, vector store, consolidation tasks)

### Readability

- Variable and function names should be self-explanatory
- Comments explain "why", not restate surface meaning of code
- Sync documentation and prompts when structure changes

## Logging and Observability

- When Logfire is configured (local CLI or `LOGFIRE_TOKEN`), reports PydanticAI traces, token/cost, routing events, memory retrieval and consolidation events; silently skipped when not configured
- Routing and memory modules still use standard logger as business event entry points, but no longer write to local `logs/*.log` rotation files by default

## Testing Conventions

- Keep pure logic as unit-testable functions
- Use `pytest`
- Current tests include:
  - Dialogue history related tests
  - Formatting tests
  - Save consistency tests
  - Vector store tests
- Tests involving vector retrieval/embedding may depend on embedding configuration in `.env`
